      Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers,
      formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are
      contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented
      in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,
      algebra, geometry, and analysis, respectively. There is no
      general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their
      academic discipline. Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of
      properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them.
      These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern
      mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties,
      called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of
      deductive rules to already established results. These results include
      previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from
      nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of
      the theory under consideration.
